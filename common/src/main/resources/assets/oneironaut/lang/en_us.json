  "oneironaut.page.spaceswap.1": "Accepts two lists of two vectors, to define two cuboids, and a Spatial Imprint. These cuboids must have the exact same dimensions and rotation.",
  "oneironaut.page.spaceswap.2": "Exchanges the blocks within the first cuboid in your current dimension (which must be within ambit) for the blocks within the second cuboid in the dimension corresponding to the Spatial Imprint. Costs 10 Charged Amethyst, plus 1 Amethyst dust per cubic meter in the cuboid.$(br2)Will not exchange any unbreakable blocks, or blocks with significant data.",
  "oneironaut.page.spaceswap.3": "Will not exchange any unbreakable blocks, or blocks with significant data.",
  "oneironaut.page.paintconjured.1": "Accepts a vector and an itemtype representing a pigment. Costs a negligible amount of media if targeting my own block, or 1 Amethyst Dust if not.",
  "oneironaut.page.paintconjured.2": "Sets the colors of the conjured block corresponding to the vector to the colorset represented by the passed pigment, or mine if passed a NULL iota.$(br2)Not guaranteed to work with unconventional forms of conjured matter. ",
  "oneironaut.page.paintconjured.3": "Feels strangely celebratory, as if something similar was once used in grand festivals where teams would splatter their colors all over their opponents' territory in a bid for ideological dominance.",
  "hexcasting.spell.oneironaut:dimteleport.comingsoon": "This will do something interesting eventually.",
  "hexcasting.spell.oneironaut:dimteleport.samedim": "The spell does not do anything, similar to if I told someone to go home, when they were already at home.",
  "oneironaut.page.dim_iotas.1": "I've descovered a kind of iota which seems to represent a layer of reality itself. In lieu of better understanding, I've decided to call these Spatial Imprints.",
  "oneironaut.page.dim_iotas.2": "Returns a Spatial Imprint representing the dimension I am currently in. Costs a negligible amount of media.",
  "oneironaut.page.dim_iotas.3": "Returns a Spatial Imprint representing the dimension my sentinel is currently in. Costs a slightly-less-negligible amount of media.",
  "oneironaut.page.dimteleport.1": "Accepts an entity and a Spatial Imprint and teleports the entity to its position in the corresponding dimension. Costs 20 Charged Amethyst.",
  "oneironaut.page.dimteleport.2": "Also triggers some sort of safety net once the target reaches its destination, in case it arrives somewhere inherently dangerous.$(br2)Will fail if supplied a player other than myself.$(br2)I get a strange sense of acceleration when subjected to this spell, but somehow it isn't along any axis I can comprehend.",
  "oneironaut.page.infusemedia.1": "Accepts a vector and infuses media into the corresponding block in order to transmute it. Cost and exact effect vary depending on target.",
  "oneironaut.page.infusemedia.2": "Conceptually, this spell is quite similar to $(l:patterns/spells/blockworks#hexcasting:edify)Edify Sapling$(/l).$(br)However, the media that the target block receives is far more finely-tuned, and can thus achieve far more interesting results.",
  "oneironaut.page.wisp_lanterns.1": "I've found that by using materials unique to the Noosphere, I can create a special jar capable of producing and containing a tiny wisp. While this wisp cannot cast anything, it emits quite a bit of light, and will mimic pigments shown to it.$(br)I can also craft a version with tinted glass, in case the wisp's light would disrupt my study's aesthetic.",
  "oneironaut.page.noosphere_materials.1": "A strange fluid that seems to stimulate my mind in pleasing ways when I immerse myself in it.",
  "oneironaut.page.noosphere_materials.2": "A rock which is primarily composed of media, somehow. Can be used to craft spell circle blocks.",
  "oneironaut.page.noosphere_materials.3.title": "Pseudoamethyst",
  "oneironaut.page.noosphere_materials.3": "A large crystal of media much like amethyst, but not quite the same. Produces a buzzing sensation under my fingers when I touch it, as if its media is stimulating the nerves. Breaking it without special care causes it to shatter into 1-4 pieces.",
  "oneironaut.page.noosphere_materials.4": "The shards can be used to fuel spells, and yield slightly more energy than a normal amethyst shard. However, they seem to reject all attempts to use them as an item's initial media reservoir. I do not know why this is, but normal Charged Amethyst is better for that purpose anyway.",
  "oneironaut.page.slipway_hint.1": "The slipways, they must lead $(o)somewhere$(). Wisps do not simply manifest from nothing. No matter what I try, I cannot insert so much as a finger through that chaotic rift.$(br2)I'm going about this wrong. Perhaps rather than attempting to force my way through, I should be attempting to calm the storm.",
  "oneironaut.page.slipway_hint.2": "A large amount of harmonious media may just do it...",
  "oneironaut.category.noosphere": "The Noosphere",
  "oneironaut.category.noosphere.desc": "What?",
  "oneironaut.page.noosphere_main.1": "I've made it.$(br)The realm beyond the slipways. The ambient media is overwhelming. My mind is screaming at me, telling me I shouldn't be here. But I must press on. This is the next step in the journey.",
  "oneironaut.page.noosphere_main.2": "Every single thing I've examined here seems to be composed largely of media, similar to conjured matter, but orders of magnitude denser.$(br)$(o)Even the air is media. How am I breathing?$(br2)$(l)How can I even exist here?",
